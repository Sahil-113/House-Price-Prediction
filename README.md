# 🏡 House Price Prediction Model



## 📌 Overview

The House Price Prediction Model is a machine learning project designed to estimate house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and more. This model leverages data-driven insights to assist buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions.

## 🔥 Features

📊 Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, outliers, and categorical data.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generates insights through visualizations.

🧠 Machine Learning Models: Implements multiple regression models to predict prices.

📈 Model Evaluation: Compares models using RMSE, R², and MAE metrics.

🎯 Deployment Ready: Can be integrated into a web app using Flask/Streamlit.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains various house features, including:

Size (sq. ft.)

Number of bedrooms & bathrooms

Location (latitude & longitude)

Age of the house

Proximity to amenities

(Dataset Source: Kaggle / Public real estate data)

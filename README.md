# House Price Prediction Model 
# Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and amenities. The model leverages regression algorithms to provide accurate price predictions, assisting buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

# Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed the dataset to understand key factors influencing house prices and identified trends.
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, outliers, and normalized numerical features for improved model performance.
Model Development: Implemented Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Random Forest Regressor for price prediction.
Performance Metrics: Evaluated the model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² Score.
# Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Algorithms: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest Regressor
Evaluation Metrics: MAE, MSE, R² Score
# Dataset
1. The dataset used is a publicly available House Price Dataset, containing features like property size, location, year built, and number of bedrooms.
2. Applied data preprocessing techniques to clean and structure the dataset for efficient model training.
# Key Insights
1. Identified significant features such as location, number of bedrooms, and property size that heavily influence house prices.
2. Built a regression model with an R² score of X, demonstrating strong predictive capability.
3. Highlighted the importance of feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.
# How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using the requirements.txt file.
3. Open and run the provided notebook/script to preprocess data, train the model, and test predictions.
4. Input new property details to predict house prices.
# Future Enhancements
1. Deployment of the model as a web or mobile application for user-friendly interaction.
2. Integration of additional datasets, including market trends and neighborhood data, for better predictions.
3. Exploration of advanced techniques like Gradient Boosting and Neural Networks for enhanced accuracy.
